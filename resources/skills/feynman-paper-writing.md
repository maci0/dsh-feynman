# Paper Writing

Load `feynman_workflow` with workflow=draft and the user’s target as input, then perform its instructions. The human can also use `/feynman draft`. The slash command expands the full workflow instructions in the active session; do not try to read a relative prompt-template path from the installed skill directory.

Agents used: `writer`, `verifier`

Output: paper draft in `papers/`.
