# Source Comparison

Load `feynman_workflow` with workflow=compare and the user’s target as input, then perform its instructions. The human can also use `/feynman compare`. The slash command expands the full workflow instructions in the active session; do not try to read a relative prompt-template path from the installed skill directory.

Agents used: `researcher`, `verifier`

Output: comparison matrix in `outputs/`.
