# ML Training Recipe

Load `feynman_workflow` with workflow=recipe and the user’s target as input, then perform its instructions. The human can also use `/feynman recipe`. The slash command expands the full workflow instructions in the active session; do not try to read a relative prompt-template path from the installed skill directory.

Agents used: `researcher`, optionally `verifier`

Output: ranked recipe brief in `outputs/` with dataset, method, code, and source provenance.
