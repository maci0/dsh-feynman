# Paper-Code Audit

Load `feynman_workflow` with workflow=audit and the user’s target as input, then perform its instructions. The human can also use `/feynman audit`. The slash command expands the full workflow instructions in the active session; do not try to read a relative prompt-template path from the installed skill directory.

Agents used: `researcher`, `verifier`

Output: audit report in `outputs/`.
